## The Condition

You are developing an application where there is a specific GET endpoint, that needs to accept data. Due to this, you cannot use Request Body to pass the data, so that you are using alternatives.

## The Problem

Currently, the endpoint accepts the data, via URL parameters. But since the data is formatted in json, it could cause encoding error.

## The Objective

Fix the method of data passing, to allow the GET endpoint to accept data. There is multiple way to do it.

## The Expected Result

The GET endpoint could accept the data.
